Title: Stochastic Flu Outbreak Simulator
Description: A Python-based Monte Carlo simulation that models the spread of a virus through a population of 60 individuals over a 60-day period using the SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model.

Key Features
Probabilistic Modeling: Uses numpy.random.binomial to simulate the chance of infection and immunity.

Infection Lifecycle: Models a 4-day progression cycle (1 day incubation, 3 days contagious).

Data Aggregation: Uses pandas to process large amounts of simulation data and calculate mean trends.

Visualization: Generates time-series plots using matplotlib to show the "flattening of the curve" based on immunity variables.
