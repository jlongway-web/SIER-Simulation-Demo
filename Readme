Title: Stochastic Flu Outbreak Simulator
Description: A Python-based Monte Carlo simulation that models the spread of a virus through a population of 60 individuals over a 60-day period using the SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model.

Key Features
Stochastic Modeling: Uses Binomial distributions to simulate the probability of infection and immunity.

Time-Lag Dynamics: Accounts for a 4-day infection cycle (1 day incubation, 3 days contagious).

Data Aggregation: Utilizes pandas to average results across multiple simulation runs to find the "Expected Value" of the outbreak.
